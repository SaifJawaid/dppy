.. _finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_add_exchange_delete:

Add/exchange/delete
===================

:cite:`AnGhRe16`, :cite:`LiJeSr16c` and :cite:`LiJeSr16d` derived variants of a Metropolis sampler having for stationary distribution :math:`\operatorname{DPP}(\mathbf{L})` :eq:`eq:likelihood_DPP_L`.
The proposal mechanism works as follows.

At state :math:`S\subset [N]`, propose :math:`S'` different from :math:`S` by at most 2 elements by picking

.. math::

    s \sim \mathcal{U}_{S}
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    t \sim \mathcal{U}_{[N]\setminus S}.

Then perform

.. _finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_E:

Exchange
--------

Pure exchange moves

.. math::

    S' \leftrightarrow S \setminus s \cup t.

.. _finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_AD:

Add-Delete
----------

Pure addition/deletion moves

- Add :math:`S' \leftrightarrow S \cup t`
- Delete :math:`S' \leftrightarrow S \setminus s`

.. _finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_AED:

Add-Exchange-Delete
-------------------

Mix of exchange and add-delete moves

- Delete :math:`S' \leftrightarrow S \setminus s`
- Exchange :math:`S' \leftrightarrow S \setminus s \cup t`
- Add :math:`S' \leftrightarrow S \cup t`

.. hint::

    Because moves are allowed between subsets having at most 2 different elements, transitions are very local inducing correlation, however *fast* mixing was proved.

.. testcode::

    import numpy as np
    from dppy.finite_dpps import FiniteDPP

    rng = np.random.RandomState(413121)

    r, N = 4, 10

    # Random feature vectors
    Phi = rng.randn(r, N)
    L = Phi.T.dot(Phi)
    DPP = FiniteDPP("likelihood", **{"L": L})

    DPP.sample_mcmc("AED", random_state=rng)  # AED, AD, E
    print(DPP.list_of_samples)  # list of trajectories, here there's only one

.. testoutput::

    [[[0, 2, 3, 6], [0, 2, 3, 6], [0, 2, 3, 6], [0, 2, 3, 6], [0, 2, 3, 6], [0, 2, 3, 6], [0, 2, 6, 9], [0, 2, 6, 9], [2, 6, 9], [2, 6, 9]]]

.. _finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_zonotope:

Zonotope
========

:cite:`GaBaVa17` target a *projection* :math:`\operatorname{DPP}(\mathbf{K})` with

.. math::

    \mathbf{K} = \Phi^{\top} [\Phi \Phi^{\top}]^{-1} \Phi,

where :math:`\Phi`, is the underlying :math:`r\times N` feature matrix satisfying :math:`\operatorname{rank}(\Phi)=\operatorname{rank}(\mathbf{K})=r`.

In this setting the :ref:`continuous_dpps_number_of_points` is almost surely equal to :math:`r` and we have

.. math::
    :label: eq:zonotope_marginal

    \mathbb{P}[\mathcal{X}=S]
    = \det \mathbf{K}_S 1_{|S|=r}
    = \frac{\det^2\Phi_{:S}}{\det\Phi \Phi^{\top}} 1_{|S|=r}
    = \frac{\operatorname{Vol}^2 \{\phi_s\}_{s\in S}}
        {\det\Phi \Phi^{\top}} 1_{|S|=r}.

The original finite ground set is embedded into a continuous domain called a zonotope.
The hit-and-run procedure is used to move across this polytope and visit the different tiles.
To recover the finite DPP samples one needs to identify the tile in which the successive points lie, this is done by solving linear programs (LPs).

.. hint::

    Sampling from a *projection* DPP boils down to solving randomized linear programs (LPs).

.. important::

    For its LPs solving needs DPPy uses the :code:`cvxopt` library, but :code:`cvxopt` is not installed by default when installing DPPy. Please refer to the `installation instructions <https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy#installation>`_ on GitHub for more details on how to install the necessary dependencies.

.. testcode::

    from numpy.random import RandomState
    from dppy.finite_dpps import FiniteDPP

    rng = RandomState(413121)

    r, N = 4, 10
    A = rng.randn(r, N)

    DPP = FiniteDPP("correlation", projection=True, **{"A_zono": A})

    DPP.sample_mcmc("zonotope", random_state=rng)
    print(DPP.list_of_samples)  # list of trajectories, here there's only one

.. testoutput::

    [[[2, 4, 5, 7], [2, 4, 5, 7], [2, 4, 5, 7], [1, 4, 5, 7], [1, 4, 5, 7], [1, 4, 5, 7], [0, 4, 7, 8], [0, 2, 7, 9], [0, 2, 7, 9], [2, 4, 5, 7]]]

.. note::

    On the one hand, the :ref:`finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_zonotope` perspective on sampling *projection* DPPs yields a better exploration of the state space.
    Using hit-and-run, moving to any other state is possible but at the cost of solving LPs at each step.
    On the other hand, the :ref:`finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_add_exchange_delete` view allows to perform cheap but local moves.

.. _finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_k_dpps:

k-DPPs
======

To preserve the size :math:`k` of the samples of :math:`k\!\operatorname{-DPP}(\mathbf{L})`, only :ref:`finite_dpps_mcmc_sampling_E` moves can be performed.

.. caution::

    :math:`k` must satisfy :math:`k \leq \operatorname{rank}(L)`

.. testcode::

    from numpy.random import RandomState
    from dppy.finite_dpps import FiniteDPP

    rng = RandomState(123)

    r, N = 5, 10

    # Random feature vectors
    Phi = rng.randn(r, N)
    L = Phi.T.dot(Phi)
    DPP = FiniteDPP("likelihood", **{"L": L})

    k = 3
    DPP.sample_mcmc_k_dpp(size=k, random_state=rng)
    print(DPP.list_of_samples)  # list of trajectories, here there's only one

.. testoutput::
